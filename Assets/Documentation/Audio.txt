Audio Manager
	• This script is created in the main menu and is destroyed only when the game ends
	• When the script is created, it initializes music and sound effects
	• The script loops through music randomly, so there is always music playing
	• There is a function to play each sound effect

How to add new music and sound effects
	• Find the game object called 'AudioManager' 
	• In the editor, there are two lists --> soundsMusic and soundsSoundEffects
	• To add music
		○ Drag and drop audio file into Audio folder
		○ Create a new element in soundsMusic in the unity editor
		○ Drag and drop audio file from Audio folder into field called 'clip'
		○ Set volume to 1 and pitch to 1
		○ Now the music will be played randomly during the game
