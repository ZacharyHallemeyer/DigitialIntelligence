# JSON Schema Documentation

## Root

The main structure is a JSON object that consists of a single field:

- `puzzles` (array): An array of puzzle objects. Each puzzle object is structured as defined below.

## Puzzle (object)

Each object in the `puzzles` array represents a puzzle and includes the following fields:

- `testCases` (array): An array of test cases. Each test case is an object as defined below.
- `hiddenTestCases` (array): An array of hidden test cases. Each hidden test case is an object as defined below.
- `clueImagePath` (string): A path to the image that contains clues to solve the puzzle.
- `startingCode` (string): A string that represents the starting code that the user will be provided with to begin solving the puzzle.
- `directions` (string): Instructions to solve the puzzle.
- `puzzleType` (string): A string that defines the type of puzzle.
- `unlockKeyword` (string): A string that serves as a keyword to unlock the next puzzle.
- `puzzleIndex` (integer): A unique identifier for each puzzle.

## Test Case and Hidden Test Case (object)

Each test case and hidden test case object contains two fields:

- `problem` (string): The problem that needs to be solved in the test case.
- `answer` (string): The correct answer for the test case.

## Note

- The `testCases` and `hiddenTestCases` arrays in the puzzle object are used to test the solutions provided by the user for the puzzle.
- The `problem` and `answer` in each test case or hidden test case can be of any valid JSON value, not just a string, and the type of value will depend on the puzzle's requirements. For example, a test case for a sorting puzzle might have an array of integers as the `problem` and `answer`.
- The `clueImagePath` can be a relative or absolute path to an image file.
- The `startingCode` is a pre-filled code to help the user to start solving the puzzle. This could be a function declaration or some variable assignments.
- The `directions` contain a detailed explanation of how to solve the puzzle.
- The `puzzleType` indicates the type of puzzle (e.g., imageSolver, wordPuzzle).
- The `unlockKeyword` is a specific keyword that allows users to unlock or progress to the next puzzle.
- The `puzzleIndex` is a unique integer that identifies the puzzle.

## How to use

- If a string is needed for test cases, Have the problem be in the format "/"problem/"" and the answer be in the format "answer"
- The unlockKeyword is used to unlock the puzzle itself besides the first puzzle. The first puzzle has the unlockKeyword to win the level...The last puzzle should show this keyword for the player to win the game
