Directions
Calculating the Fibonacci sequence value is your mission! Follow these steps:
    1. Take the given integer as input to your main function.
    2. Calculate the Fibonacci sequence value for the given number using the appropriate method.
    3. Return the Fibonacci sequence value as the final result of your function.

About the Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1.
For example, the Fibonacci sequence begins as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.
Each number is obtained by adding the two previous numbers in the sequence. The first two numbers are defined as 0 and 1.

Calculation Process
To calculate the Fibonacci sequence value for a given number, follow these steps:
    - If the given number is 0, return 0.
    - If the given number is 1, return 1.
    - For any other number, recursively calculate the sum of the Fibonacci sequence values for the two preceding numbers.
    - Continue this process until you reach the given number in the sequence.

Example
Let's calculate the Fibonacci sequence value for the number 10 using the steps above:
- The Fibonacci sequence value for 10 is 55, so we would return 55.

Now it's your turn! Write a function that accepts an integer as input, calculates the Fibonacci sequence value, and follows the steps above to return the Fibonacci sequence value as the final result. Good luck!
