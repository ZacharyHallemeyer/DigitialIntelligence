Prometheus, a Titan, loved humanity and felt compassion for their suffering. To help them, he stole the divine fire from Olympus, a symbol of knowledge, civilization, and technology, and gifted it to mortals. This act of defiance enraged Zeus, who was the ruler of the gods. In retaliation, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains, where a vulture or eagle would devour his liver every day. Prometheus endured this torment for centuries until he was eventually freed by Heracles (Hercules) as part of one of his labors.
