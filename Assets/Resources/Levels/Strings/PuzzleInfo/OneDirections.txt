Directions:

For this puzzle, you will need to reverse the input string `s` and return the reversed string. A good method would be to use a for or while loop.

When you use a loop, you can move from character to character in a string with indexes

Code
==========================
myString = "Hello!"
for index in range(len(myString)):
	print(myString[index])
==========================

Output
==========================
H
e
l
l
o
!
