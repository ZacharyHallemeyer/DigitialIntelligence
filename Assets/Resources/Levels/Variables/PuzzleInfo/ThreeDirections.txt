Directions:
There are many things that you can do with variables. One of the main ways to use variables is to perform mathematical operations on the variables

Operations:
• + → will add two values, for instance, 1 + 1 will result in two and variableOne + variableTwo will result in the sum 
• - → will subtract two values, for instance, 1 - 1 will result in zero and variableOne - variableTwo will result in the difference
• * → will multiply two values, for instance, 1 * 1 will result in one and variableOne * variableTwo will result in the product 
• / → will divide two values, for instance, 1 / 1 will result in two and variableOne / variableTwo will result in the quotient

CODE
==========================
numberVariable = 5
numberVariable = numberVariable + 5
print(numberVariable) # This will print 10

numberVariable = 5
numberVariable += 5
print(numberVariable) # This will print 10
==========================

For this puzzle, Follow the directions in the code. You will need to perform mathematical operations on a variable called numberVariables.
