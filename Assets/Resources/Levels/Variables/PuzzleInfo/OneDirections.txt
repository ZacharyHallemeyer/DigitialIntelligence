Directions:

Variables are like boxes that you can place items in. Each variable can be named a different name and can store any values. So if a box is named "books", and you would place books in the box.

In programming, variables work in a similar way. A variable is like a box where you can store different kinds of information, which in programming terms, we call data. This could be a number, a word (which we call a "string"), a list of items, and so on.

More specifically, A VARIABLE HOLDS VALUE

For this puzzle, you will need to set a variable to a new value by following directions in the code.
