Directions:

Conditionals are like instructions for a computer to make decisions. They allow you to tell the computer, "If something is true, do one thing. Otherwise, do something else."

Conditionals are either true or false. In Python, there are Booleans (written as bool) which can hold either True or False. For example:

CODE
==========================
trueBool = True
falseBool = False
==========================

Booleans can be assigned directly or by using comparison operators. The available comparison operators are listed below:

• Equal to: ==
	○ 1 == 1 # True
	○ 1 == 2 # False
• Not equal to: !=
	○ "Hello" != "Hello" # False
	○ "Hello" != "World" # True
• Greater than: >
	○ 2 > 1 # True
	○ 1 > 1 # False
• Less than: <
	○ 1 < 2 # True
	○ 1 < 1 # False
• Greater than or equal to: >=
	○ 1 >= 1 # True
	○ 1 >= 3 # True
• Less than or equal to: <=
	○ 1 <= 1 # True
	○ 1 <= 2 # True
With comparison operators, we can compute our own boolean variables as seen below:

CODE
==========================
booleanVariable = 1 < 2 # True
booleanVariable = 2 < 1 # False
==========================

For the puzzle, you need to check if the number passed into the function main is less than or equal to the variable testingNumber and return the calculated value.
