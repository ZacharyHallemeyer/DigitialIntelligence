Directions
Sorting an integer list is your task! Follow these steps:
1. Start with the given list of integers.
2. Sort the list in ascending order.
   - For example, [2, 1, 4, 3] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4].
3. Once you have sorted the list, it will be the final result.
4. Remember to return the sorted list as the output of your function.

Example:
Sort the list [2, 1, 4, 3] using the steps above:
- After sorting, the list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4].

Now it's your turn! Write a function to sort the given list of integers, following these steps. Good luck!
