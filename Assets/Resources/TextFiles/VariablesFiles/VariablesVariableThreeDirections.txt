Directions:
There are many things that you can do with variables. One of the main ways to use variables is to perform mathematical operations on the variables

Operations:
• +
	○ + will add two values, for instance 1 + 1 will result in two and variableOne + variableTwo will result in the sum of the values in variableOne and variableTwo
• -
	○ - will add subtract two values, for instance 1 - 1 will result in zero and variableOne - variableTwo will result in the difference of the values in variableOne and variableTwo
• *
	○ * will add multiply two values, for instance 1 * 1 will result in one and variableOne * variableTwo will result in the product of the values in variableOne and variableTwo
• /
	○ / will add divide two values, for instance 1 / 1 will result in two and variableOne / variableTwo will result in the quotient of the values in variableOne and variableTwo

Examples:

numberVariable = 5
numberVariable = numberVariable + 5
print(numberVariable) # This will print 10

numberVariable = 5
numberVariable -= 5
print(numberVariable) # This will print 0

For this puzzle, Follow the directions in the code. You will need to perform mathematical operations on a variable called numberVariables.
