Directions:
Variables can also hold a datatype known as strings. Strings are text that the computer can hold and use. For instance, a variable can hold the sentence: "Hello World!" as a string

Examples of Strings:

stringVariable = "Hello World!"
print(stringVariable) # This will print HelloWorld

Strings can be modified and manipulated with python code. A basic way to do this is to add two strings with + which is called concatenation

Examples of concatenation

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
print(firstName + lastName) # Prints JohnDoe

For this puzzle, you will have to follow the directions in the code. You will need to concatenate two strings and return the concatenation.
