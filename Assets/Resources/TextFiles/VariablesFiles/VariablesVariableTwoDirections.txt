Directions:
Parameters are utilized within functions. These are variables or values that are fed into a function, to be used within that function. Here's an example:

CODE
==========================
def main(variable): # 'variable' is the parameter
print(variable)

main(5) # Here, '5' is the argument passed to the function
main(10) # Here, '10' is the argument passed to the function
==========================

In this case, '5' and '10' are the arguments we're passing to our function main, and the variable is the parameter that receives these arguments.

5 and 10 will be printed on different lines after this code runs.
