<color=#800020>Python Standard Library</color>

The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules and packages that come with Python and provide a wide range of functionality. It includes modules for working with file I/O, regular expressions, networking, and much more. You can use these modules to save time and effort when developing Python applications.

For example, you can use the `os` module to perform file and directory operations, the `datetime` module to work with dates and times, and the `json` module to work with JSON data.

CODE
===========================
import os
import datetime
import json

# Example usage of standard library modules
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current directory: {current_directory}")

current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
print(f"Current time: {current_time}")

data = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}'
parsed_data = json.loads(data)
print(parsed_data)
