<color=#800020>Scope</color>

Scope determines where in your code a particular variable or name is valid and can be used. Understanding scope is crucial for writing clean and bug-free code. Python uses indentation (a tab or 4 spaces) to show scope. Identation is used in functions, if statements, loops, etc.

Code
======================
globalVariable = "World"

def main():
	localVariable = "Hello"
	print(localVariable + " " globalVariable)	

main() <color=#23D1BA># This will print "Hello World" because globalVariable is defined outside of a function</color>
print(localVariable) <color=#23D1BA># This will cause an error because localVariable can only be used in the main function</color>
