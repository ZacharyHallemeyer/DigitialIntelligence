<color=#800020>Loops</color>

Loops are used in Python to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. Python has two main types of loops: "for" loops and "while" loops.

<color=#7500a3>For Loops</color>

For loops are used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a block of code. They are often used for iterating over a sequence (like a list or a string).

CODE
===========================
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}s")

# Iterating over a range of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# This will print numbers 0 through 4

# Using the enumerate function to access both index and value
for index, value in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {value}")
===========================

<color=#7500a3>While Loops</color>

While loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. They are useful when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run.

CODE
===========================
# Using a while loop to count down from 5
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
# This will print numbers 5 through 1

# Using a while loop with user input
user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
while user_input != "quit":
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
    user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
# This will keep asking for input until the user enters 'quit'
===========================

<color=#7500a3>Control Statements in Loops</color>

Inside loops, you can use control statements to change the flow of the loop. Common control statements include "break" and "continue."

CODE
===========================
# Using break to exit a loop prematurely
for number in range(10):
    if number == 5:
        break
    print(number)
# This will print numbers 0 through 4 and then exit the loop

# Using continue to skip the current iteration and move to the next
for number in range(5):
    if number == 2:
        continue
    print(number)
# This will print numbers 0, 1, 3, and 4, skipping 2
===========================
