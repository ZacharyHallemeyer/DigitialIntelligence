<color=#800020>Conditionals</color>	

Conditionals allow a program to execute certain sections of code depending on if a condition is true or not.

<color=#7500a3>Comparison Operators</color> - These are used to compare values. They return either True or False.
	
	• Equal to (==)
	• Not equal to (!=)
	• Greater than (>)
	• Less than (<)
	• Greater than or equal to (>=)
	• Less than or equal to (<=)

<color=#7500a3>Logical Operators</color> - These are used to combine conditional statements.

	• And (and) - True and True -> evaluates to True ; True and False -> evaluates to False
	• Or (or) - True or True -> evaluates to True ; True or False -> evaluates to True
	• Not (not) - True and not True -> evaluates to False ; True and not False -> evaluates to True

<color=#7500a3>If statements</color>

If statements check if a condition is true or false. If the condition is True, the code indented below it is run.	


CODE
============================
# the if statements if the condition is true and executes the code block following it if the condition is true.
if 10 > 5:
	print("10 is greater than 5")

# The above prints "10 is greater than 5"

# Else statement
# The else statement catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
if 5 > 10:
	print("5 is greater than 10")
else:
	print("5 is not greater than 10")
# The above prints "5 is not greater than 10"

# Elif statement
# The elif keyword is a way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition". It stands for "else if".
if 5 > 10:
	print("5 is greater than 10")
elif 5 == 5:
	print("5 is equal to 5")
else:
	print("5 is not greater than 10")
# The above prints "5 is equal to 5"
