Functions are like workers. They preform a specified task when they are called to do so. You have already been using functions as each puzzle uses a main function and returns a value at the end of the function. 

This is the basics of a function. A function has code that will be run each time it is run. It can return a value or it can return nothing. This basic syntax is as follows

def myFunction():
	
	# Code here

	# return here
