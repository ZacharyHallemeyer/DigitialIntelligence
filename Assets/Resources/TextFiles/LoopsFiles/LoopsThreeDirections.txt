Directions:

For this puzzle, you will need to find the factorial of the number passed into main called `number`. To calculate the factorial of a number, see below

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, represented as n!, is calculated as:

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1

In other words, it is the product of all positive integers from n down to 1.

For example:

0! = 1 (by convention)
1! = 1
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
and so on...
