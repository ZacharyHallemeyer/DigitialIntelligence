Directions:
Loops are structures that allow you to repeat a piece of code multiple times. There are two main types of functions called `for` and `while`

For loops are used for iterating over data. For instance, a for loop is able to iterate over each character in a string and every element in a list. 
The basic syntax is seen below 

CODE
==========================
for index in range(10):
	print(index) # This will print 0 to 9 

for index in range(1, 11):
	print(index) # This will print 1 to 10
==========================

For this puzzle, you will need to calculate the sum of all numbers less than the parameter called `limit`
