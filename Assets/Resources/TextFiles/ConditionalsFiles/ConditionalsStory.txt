In this section, we will explore conditionals. Conditionals are like decision-makers in programming, allowing your code to make choices based on certain conditions or criteria. They enable your programs to adapt and respond differently depending on the situation. By using conditionals, you can create logic that branches and executes specific instructions only when certain conditions are met, making your code more versatile and capable of handling complex tasks. Understanding how to implement conditionals is a fundamental skill in programming, enabling you to create responsive and intelligent software.
