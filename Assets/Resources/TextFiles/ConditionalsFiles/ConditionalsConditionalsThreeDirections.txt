Directions:

There are also if-else statements (elif). The if-else statements are used to check multiple conditions in a sequence. The structure is as follows:

if(conditionOne):
# This code runs if conditionOne is True
elif(conditionTwo):
# This code runs if conditionOne is False and conditionTwo is True
else:
# This code runs if conditionOne and conditionTwo are False
