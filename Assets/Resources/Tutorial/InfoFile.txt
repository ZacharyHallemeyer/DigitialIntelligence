You have run your first commands! Great job!

This level will be easy as we are just learning the ropes of the game. There is a locked file and a locked directory in the current directory. 

For the locked file, you will need to use the command `hint` to print the question that you must answer in order to unlock it. You will then answer the question with the `unlock command`. Let's go over an example where I want to unlock a file called Test.txt

	• hint Test.txt	
		○ Prints " 1 + 1 " to the terminal. This is the question that we must answer
	• unlock Test.txt 2
		○ This unlocks the file as 1 + 1 is equal to 2

After unlocking the file, you can read through its content
