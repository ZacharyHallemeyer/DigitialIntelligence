In the beginning, there was Chaos, a formless and infinite void from which everything would eventually emerge. From Chaos, two primal forces took shape: Gaia, the Earth, and Uranus, the Sky. They became the first divine couple and gave birth to the Titans, powerful beings who ruled the cosmos. The Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, with one eye and a hundred arms respectively, were also born to them. However, Uranus feared his monstrous children and imprisoned them in the depths of the Earth, which enraged Gaia. She conspired with her son Cronus to overthrow Uranus. This act set in motion a chain of events that would shape the destiny of the gods.
