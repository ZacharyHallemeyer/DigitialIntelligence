Persephone was the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of agriculture. Hades, the god of the Underworld, fell in love with Persephone and decided to abduct her while she was picking flowers in a meadow. Demeter, consumed by grief and anger over her daughter's disappearance, caused a severe drought and famine on Earth. Eventually, Zeus intervened and negotiated a deal: Persephone would spend part of the year with Hades in the Underworld and the other part on Earth with her mother. This division of time is said to represent the changing seasons: when Persephone is in the Underworld, Demeter mourns, leading to winter, and when she returns, Demeter rejoices, bringing forth spring and summer.
