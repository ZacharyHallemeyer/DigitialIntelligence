Pandora was the first woman created by the gods as a punishment for humanity. Zeus, angry at Prometheus for stealing fire and giving it to humans, ordered Hephaestus, the blacksmith god, to craft Pandora. Zeus gave her a box (sometimes referred to as a jar) with strict instructions never to open it. Curiosity got the better of Pandora, and she opened the box, unleashing all the evils and miseries into the world. She managed to close the box just in time to trap one thing inside: hope. This myth serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of curiosity and the enduring importance of hope in the face of adversity.
