The Minotaur, a monstrous half-bull, half-human creature, resided in the labyrinth on the island of Crete. Every year, Athens was forced to send seven young men and seven maidens as sacrifices to the Minotaur, a punishment for past crimes. Theseus, the brave prince of Athens, volunteered to be part of the group sent to Crete to end this cycle of horror. With the help of Princess Ariadne, who fell in love with him, Theseus entered the labyrinth, slew the Minotaur, and found his way back out using a ball of string given to him by Ariadne. His victory ended the cruel practice and established him as a hero.
