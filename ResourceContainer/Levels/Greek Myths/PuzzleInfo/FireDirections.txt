Directions:
Decrypting a secret message is your mission! Follow these steps:
1. Examine the encrypted string, character by character.
2. Replace each character with the one that is 5 places up in the alphabet.
   - For example, 'a' becomes 'f', and 'z' becomes 'e'.
3. Continue this process until you've replaced all characters.
4. The resulting string is your decrypted message.
5. Remember to return the decrypted string as the final output of your function.

Example:
Decrypt 'czggj' using the steps above:
   - 'c' becomes 'h'
   - 'z' becomes 'e'
   - 'g' becomes 'l'
   - 'g' becomes 'l'
   - 'j' becomes 'o'

So, 'czggj' decrypts to 'hello'.

Now it's your turn! Write a function to decrypt the given encrypted string, following these steps. Good luck!
