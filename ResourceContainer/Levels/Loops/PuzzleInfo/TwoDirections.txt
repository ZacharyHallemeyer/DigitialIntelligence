Directions:
A while loop is similar to a for loop as it allows a block of code to be repeated. However, a while loop runs only when a condition is meet. 
For instance, the below while loop will run forever as the condition is always true

CODE
==========================
while(True):
	print("I will never stop")
==========================

and the while loop below will never run

CODE
==========================
while(False):
	print("I will never run")
==========================

While loops run as long as the condition results in true. An example of this is below where the while loop runs until index is greater than the limit

CODE
==========================
count = 1
limit = 10
while(count <= limit):
	print(count) # This will print 1 through 10
	count += 1
==========================

For this puzzle, the main function will accept a parameter called `searchValue` and has a list called `numberList`. You will need to check if `searchValue` is an element in the `numberList`. If the `searchValue` exists in `numberList`, you need to return the index of the `searchValue`. If `searchValue` does not exist in `numberList`, you need to return -1

To get the length of a list use the function len(), so if we do len(numberList) we get 5.
