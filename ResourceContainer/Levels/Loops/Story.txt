In this module, we'll delve into loops. Loops are like the workhorses of programming, enabling you to repeat a specific set of instructions multiple times. They're like the "do it again" command for your code. Loops are invaluable when you need to perform a task repeatedly, such as processing large amounts of data, iterating through lists, or executing actions until a certain condition is met. Mastering loops is a fundamental skill that empowers your code to efficiently handle repetitive tasks, making your programs more dynamic and powerful.
