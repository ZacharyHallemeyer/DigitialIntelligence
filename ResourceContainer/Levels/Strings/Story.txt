In this section, we'll explore strings. Strings are sequences of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols, that play a crucial role in programming. They're like the text you write in a document, but in the coding world. Strings are versatile and are used for everything from displaying messages to processing and manipulating textual data. Understanding how to work with strings is fundamental in programming, as they are an essential part of communicating, storing information, and performing various operations within your code.
