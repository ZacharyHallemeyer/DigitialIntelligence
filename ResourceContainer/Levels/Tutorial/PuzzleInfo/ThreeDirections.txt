You may have already noticed that there is code that looks like the following in the previous puzzles

CODE
==========================
  def main():
	return ""
==========================

This is because the system checks the return values to make sure that the puzzle has been completed. Basically, you will be instructed to return a value after the keyword `return` in the function called main. The value you return will be tested with the correct output and if your output matches the correct output, the puzzle will be solved.

For this puzzle, simply return the value "Hi" and run the tests.
